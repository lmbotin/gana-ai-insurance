## 1-Line Description
An AI-native insurance carrier delivering cheaper, faster, and more transparent insurance through end-to-end automation.

---

## Overview
Legacy insurance carriers rely on large, manual, and opaque processes across underwriting, policy management, and claims handling.  
Gana explores how recent advances in AI enable a **super-lean insurance organization**, with humans in the loop only where judgment is truly required.

This project focuses on **claims automation**, spanning:
- Multimodal First Notice of Loss (FNOL)
- Computer vision–based damage assessment
- Smart claims routing
- Fraud detection and risk scoring
- End-to-end claim state visibility

---

## Success Metrics
- Straight-Through Processing (STP) rate
- Claim resolution time
- Fraud precision / recall
- Human intervention rate
