# Data

This project uses **synthetic or publicly available** data only.

- `raw/` — untouched inputs (ignored by git)
- `processed/` — cleaned/standardized outputs (ignored by git)
- `synthetic/` — generated sample claims for demos/evaluation (ignored by git)

To share small example data, place it in a new folder `data/sample/` and commit only that.
